# RolexPricePrediction
---
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the prices of Rolex watches using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, watch specifications, and market trends, we develop a predictive model to estimate the resale value of Rolex watches.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Scraped and cleaned historical pricing data for Rolex watches from various sources.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted key factors such as model, year, material, condition, and demand trends.  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented regression models like **Linear Regression** to predict watch prices.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy and reduce mean absolute error (MAE).  
- **Insights & Visualization**: Analyzed pricing trends over time and provided data-driven insights for potential buyers and sellers.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, ipwidgets)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Google Colab** for experimentation  

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **90% accuracy** in price prediction.  
- Identified key factors influencing Rolex prices.  
- Provided an interactive dashboard for visualizing pricing trends.
